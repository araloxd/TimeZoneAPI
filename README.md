Build a Time-Zone Aware To-Do List Application
Requirements:
Core Functionality:


User Authentication: Implement a secure user authentication system with login and password protection.
Task Creation and Editing: Allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
Task Prioritization: Implement a system to prioritize tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
Task Due Dates: Users should be able to set due dates for tasks.
Task Completion: Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
Task Search: Implement a search functionality to filter tasks based on keywords.
Time Zone Handling:


User-Specific Time Zones: Allow users to set their preferred time zone in their account settings.
Time Zone-Aware Display: Display task due dates and creation times in the user's local time zone.
Time Zone Conversion for Server-Side Operations: Ensure that server-side operations (e.g., scheduling tasks) consider the user's time zone.
Additional Features (Optional):


Task Recurrence: Allow users to set recurring tasks (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
Task Categories: Allow users to categorize tasks for better organization. (tags would also be accepted)
User Profiles: Provide a user profile page where users can view their task history and settings.
Submission Guidelines:
Code Repository: Submit your code to a public repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and provide a link to the repository.
Deployment: If possible, deploy the application to a publicly accessible URL.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application.
Testing: Include unit tests and integration tests to demonstrate code quality.
Evaluation Criteria:
Code Quality: Code readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
Functionality: Implementation of all required features and additional features.
Security: Security best practices, including input validation, output encoding, and secure authentication.
Testing: Thorough testing coverage to ensure code quality and reliability. (We donâ€™t need to see full coverage but some example of tests please)
Documentation: Clear and concise documentation to aid understanding and maintenance.
By completing this task, you will demonstrate your ability to design, develop, and deploy a robust and scalable web application using C# and .NET.
